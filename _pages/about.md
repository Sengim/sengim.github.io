I'm a PhD student in the Cybersecurity group at Leiden University, where I started in 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Stjepan Picek and Dr. Marina Krcek. Before this, I completed my Master's at TU Delft.

My research focuses on deep-learning based side-channel analysis and AI security. I work on using machine learning to break cryptographic implementations and understanding vulnerabilities in AI systems themselves.

I've published at venues like ASIACRYPT, NeurIPS, and TIFS, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and hardware security.
