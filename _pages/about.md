Since 2023 I'm a PhD student at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) in Leiden University, under the supervision of Stjepan Picek and Marina Krcek. Before this, I completed my Master's at TU Delft in 2022 (also under the supervision of Stjepan Picek).

Broadly, my research is focused on the intersections of AI and security. My work centers on deep-learning-based side-channel analysis (DLSCA), with an emphasis on improving the robustness and practical reliability of such attacks. I am particularly interested in using interpretability methods to understand how models succeed in breaking implementations, as well as exploring generative techniques to enhance data efficiency and attack performance. In parallel, I am also studying the interpretability of AI systems more generally in security contexts.
